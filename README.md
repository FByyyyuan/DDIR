**DDIR: Domain-Disentangled Invariant Representation Learning for Tailored Predictions**

Official PyTorch implementation of DDIR.

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of DDIR (Domain-Disentangled Invariant Representation Learning). The project is built on top of the SWAD and DomainBed codebases.

This work has been accepted by Knowledge-Based Systems.

## Model Overview
Traditional training methods often struggle to scale effectively with large datasets due to significant distributional differences. Domain generalization (DG) aims to address the challenge of generalizing across multiple-source domains and improving performance in unknown target domains. While many DG methods, such as domain-invariant representation (DIR) learning, excel in handling significant distribution shifts, they often sacrifice performance on in-distribution (IID) data. This trade-off is crucial in real-world applications with uncertain distribution shifts, spanning both out-of-distribution (OOD) and IID scenarios. 

To address this, we identify DIRâ€™s limitation in neglecting task-relevant non-domain-invariant information, termed Domain-Orthogonal Invariant (DOI) information.  We propose a **Domain-Disentangled Invariant Representation (DDIR)** learning, which retains DOI information without introducing redundancy. Our method introduces an information disentanglement loss to extract domain-invariant and different DOI information within a single backbone, achieving lower spatial complexity. Moreover, during inference, we propose optimal DOI selection approaches for individual target samples to avoid utilizing redundant DOI information, enabling tailored predictions for each target sample. Experiments demonstrate DDIR's effectiveness in enhancing generalization performance across IID and OOD scenarios.

**Core Contributions:**
- Analyzing the limitations of DIR methods in IID and OOD scenarios and proposing DDIR learning.
- Designing a single-backbone framework for DDIR learning, which separates and preserves DOI information without redundancy.
- Proposing a DOI selection strategy to adapt to individual target instances without requiring knowledge of the target domain distribution.
