# Code repository for DDIR

**Rethinking Domain Invariant Representations: Domain-Disentangled Invariant Representation Learning**

PyTorch implementation of DDIR. This project is built upon SWAD and DomainBed codebases.

## How to Run

`train.py` script conducts multiple leave-one-out cross-validations for all target domain.
